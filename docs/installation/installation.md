# Installation Types

** There are two different types of installation for the DWCJ: **


- For those who want to develop applications or web tools using the DWCJ,
the [Users installation page](/docs/installation/users) will work perfectly.

- Developers who want to also make changes to the DWCJ itself can follow
the [Contributors installation page](/docs/installation/developer) to begin making changes to the API.
